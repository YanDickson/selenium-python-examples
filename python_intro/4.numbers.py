# Creating integers a, b and c
a = 1
b = 35656222
c = -3255522

# Creating floats x, y and z
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

# This expression is True since the value of x is more than y
x > y

# This expression is False since the value of b is ot less than a
b < a

# This expression is True since the value of  is 1
a == 1
